                <div class='aboutText'>Hello! Welcome! My name is Kenneth Cairney. I am a Writer and Archaeologist by education, a Web Developer and System Administrator by chance. It has been a long road from where I started to where I am. I am proud of what I have accomplished and I am happy with the road ahead. In youth it is difficult to decide where you want to be, but what matters is the perpetual pursuit of self-improvement. I have been incredibly fortunate in my experiences, and the assistance and education I have received from so many incredible people is invaluable to me.Though my university studies were a pursuit of subjects I am quite passionate about, it is often the case that our passions are not the most employable. The wonderful thing is that though I might not be working in Literature or Archaeology, they are always in my mind and always hobbies. The key is that regardless of where I work I will always pursue my continuing education. My recent step into System Administration has opened doors I never expected and inspired me to pursue another avenue of self-education. There is an abundance of languages and ideas to explore in the programming and development world, and this is just the first step on a new journey. I hope you enjoy my collection of work and check back to see my growth on this continuing journey.</div>

It is a straightforward collection of book reviews designed to look like a library or pile of books. Using jquery each book cover changes to a more legible form and links to the review itself. The bigger challenge came from the recommendations page. Wanting to practice more javascript, I wrote a randomizer for book recommendations. The reader selects which genre they'd like a recommnedation for and the page loads a book I have read in that genre. All the books included are books I have read and enjoyed, though not all have a written review. Those that have written reviews link to the review and those that don't link to website where more information on the book can be obtained.</div>
                <div id='HTP'><a id='linkpond' href="http://hoppingthepond.co.uk">Hopping The Pond</a><br>A website designed around the idea of polaroid snapshots. My wife and I began blogging about our experiences abroad and this was the perfect opportunity to develop my own website. The site was designed to be simple and straight forward. Polaroid pictures of each topic link to articles. For those searching for specific location, a collapseable list organized by country was added. The page utilizes HTML/CSS as well as a bit of jquery for both the link highlights and the collapseable country list. CSS was used to design the polaroid look of each link.</div>
